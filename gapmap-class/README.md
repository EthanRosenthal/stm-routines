Gapmap-Class
============

These routines are used for classifying regions of a sample as indiciative of either superconductivity (SC) or spin density wave (SDW) based upon the shape of the dI/dV curve.

These regions of the sample are identified by generating a dI/dV map of the sample. This corresponds to measuring the derivative of a Current-Voltage (I/V) curve on a 2D grid in space. The shape of this curve at each pixel can be used to classify the dominant property of the sample at that spatial position (SC or SDW).

See the plot below for dI/dV curves indicative of SC and SDW.
